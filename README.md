Deploy to GitHub Pages
----------------------

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages under the `textal` repository name. To publish:

1. Make sure your repository is named `textal` (or update the `base` in `vite.config.mjs` to match).
2. Commit and push your code to GitHub.
3. Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will run `vite build` and publish the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch using the `gh-pages` package.

If your repo name differs, set the `base` option in `vite.config.mjs` to `'/your-repo-name/'` before building.
